### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Even though I have a public GitHub profile, most of my code these days is paid for and thus closed-source. So I cannot publish here the interesting code I have most recently written. 

Anyway, my programming philosophy is that the aim of programming is to reduce the complexity of a problem and to communicate that clearly to anyone reading the code. 

Some of the lessons I learned over the 15 years of professional programming are summarized here: [software-development-guidelines](https://github.com/ili3p/software-development-guidelines)
